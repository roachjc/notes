The following serves to document my learning. It provides a reference for topics I have been over and might need my memory jogged. In writing these notes, it also helps me better understand complex subject matter or areas that for whatever reason I find hard to digest.

It is entirely for my own benefit and so may skim over some things I feel I know well, and go on at length about simple things I have had trouble wrapping my head around.
