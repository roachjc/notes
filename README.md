# Gatsby site for storing my notes

#### This Project was bootstrapped with [Gatsby Starter Docs](https://github.com/ericwindmill/gatsby-starter-docs)

### [Demo](https://gatsby-docs-starter.netlify.com/)

Gatsby Starter Docs provides everything but the content. You could just write all your lessons in markdown files, configure a few lines of code, and have a completely built documentation website.
